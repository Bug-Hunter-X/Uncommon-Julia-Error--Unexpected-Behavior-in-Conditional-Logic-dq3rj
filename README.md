# Uncommon Julia Error: Unexpected Behavior in Conditional Logic

This example demonstrates a subtle error in Julia code that can be difficult to track down.  The function `my_function` is designed to handle different input values (`x`) according to specific conditions, but there might be edge cases or unexpected behavior depending on how the conditions are evaluated and handled.

The `bug.jl` file contains the original code, while `bugSolution.jl` provides a possible solution and explanation.
